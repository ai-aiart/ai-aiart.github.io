Welcome to the website of [Lab Name], where cutting-edge technology meets the future of healthcare. We are a research lab situated at [University Name], dedicated to the field of radiotherapy through the innovative application of computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI).

Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is an advanced approach to cancer treatment that continuously adjusts radiation therapy plans based on the  patient's anatomy and needs. As opposed to applying radiation to the whole patient's body, with ART minimizes the radiation each patient receives on healthy tissue during their treatment. This offers a highly precise and patient-centric solution that can improve treatment outcomes, particularly in cases where tumors are located near critical organs or structures.

The workflow of ART techniques involves several specialists with different backgrounds. For example, the radiation oncologist has to segment the target volume of the cancer and segment also the organs that are at risk of being hit with radiation.

And our <b>mission</b> is to conduct research on improving computer vision techniques and sharing them in a way that improves the workflow of the radiotherapy planning.
